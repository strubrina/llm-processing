# General Guidelines

- Focus on accuracy over guessing
- Provide a confidence score ranging from 1.0 (very certain) to 0.0 (very uncertain)
- Use the full letter text as primary evidence for disambiguation
- Consider all available biographical/geographical information
- If no clear match can be determined, choose the most likely candidate but assign a lower confidence score

# Selection Rules

## GND (Persons)

**Use letter text to identify:**
- Professional context (scholar, diplomat, artist)
- Topics discussed (orientalism, history, arts)
- Locations and networks mentioned

**Time period:** Candidate must be alive 1794-1856 (check birth/death years)


## GeoNames (Places)

**Use letter text to identify:**
- Geographical context (other places mentioned)
- Political/cultural references (embassy, university)
- Travel routes or descriptions

**Prioritize:** Capitals (PPLC) and major cities over villages for diplomatic/scholarly correspondence


## If Missing Letter Text

Rely on: name matching quality, date consistency, biographical plausibility. Assign confidence ≤0.7.
  - Name matching quality
  - Date consistency
  - Biographical plausibility
  - Assign lower confidence scores (typically below 0.7)

### Single Candidate:
- Still analyze letter text to confirm it's the correct match
- Can assign lower confidence if textual evidence doesn't support

### All Candidates Seem Implausible:
- Choose the least implausible option
- Assign very low confidence (<0.5)


**Confidence:**
- 1.0: Clear location evidence in text + feature type fits
- 0.9: Good contextual support + appropriate type
- 0.7-0.8: Some context + plausible location
- 0.5-0.6: Name match but limited context (favor larger cities)
- <0.5: Uncertain

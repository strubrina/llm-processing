# General Guidelines

- Focus on accuracy over guessing
- Use the full letter text as primary evidence for disambiguation
- Consider biographical/geographical information
- If all candidates seem implausible, set "gnd" or "geonamesID" value to "unclear"
- Use the preferredName for the value of the writer key in the output JSON object; when gnd is "unclear", use the best inferable writer from the input
- Provide a certainty level


# Selection Rules

## GND (Persons)

**Name quality indicators:**
- Full names with particles are more reliable than abbreviated names
- Abbreviated names (e.g., "J.") may require more textual evidence

**Use letter text to identify:**
- Professional context (scholar, diplomat, artist, merchant)
- Topics discussed (orientalism, history, arts, trade)
- Locations and networks mentioned
- Relationships (colleague of X, student of Y)

## GeoNames (Places)

**Use letter text to identify:**
- Name of location in dateline or text
- Geographical context (other places mentioned)
- Political/cultural references (embassy, university)
- Travel routes or descriptions

**Prioritize:** Capitals (PPLC) and major cities over villages for diplomatic/scholarly correspondence


## Certainty

**Persons:**
- "high": Strong contextual evidence (profession, network, topics)
- "med": Name components (surname or forename) or abbreviated names and moderate evidence
- "low": flagged for human review (always use when GND "unclear")

**Places:**
- "high": Named in dateline or letter text as location of writer and/or supported by geographical context
- "med":  Abbreviated place name  and moderate evidence
- "low": weak evidence, but contextually plausible - flagged for human review (always use when geonamesID "unclear")

Use `"cert"` when only one type is resolved; use `"gnd_cert"` and `"geo_cert"` when both are resolved in the same record.

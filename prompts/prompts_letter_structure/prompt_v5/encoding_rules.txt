# Encoding Rules for Letter Structure

## General Remarks:
- Maintain original historical spelling and orthography.
- Preserve special characters and foreign words as they appear in the text.
- Ensure consistency with TEI Guidelines (except for salutations and addresses - see rules below)
- Preserve the original structure, and order
- Do not abbreviate any text. Fully represent all letter content in the XML output
- Only return the XML code without additional explanations.

## 1. Document sectioning
- Start with a body element as the root and use the following child elements for general structuring
- Use a div typed "letter" for the main letter including dateline, salutations, letter content, signature and postscript
- Use a div typed "address" for addresses


## 2. Document layout
- Maintain original paragraph sectioning
- Mark new line beginnings only in salutations and signatures using an lb tag

## 3. Letter Structure
- If a letter contains multiple writing sessions (indicated by multiple datelines) wrap each writing session into a div typed as "writingSession"
- Use salute tags for salutations
- Use dateline tags for datelines
- Use signed tags for the signature of the letter
- Use a postscript tag for any letter text after the closer with a nested p element for paragraphs
- Use p tags for any other letter content between opener and closer if available

**Exception from TEI valid encoding**: Contrary to the standard TEI content model, p elements may contain a salute element when the salutation is embedded within a paragraph and not visually set off as a separate block.

### Handling Salutations
Two encoding patterns apply depending on the visual layout:

**Block-level salutations** (visually set off - on its own line):
- Wrap in salute tags
- Include in opener (at beginning) or closer (at end) tags

**Embedded salutations** (within paragraph text):
- Wrap in salute tags within the p element
- Do NOT wrap in opener or closer tags

### Note on opener and closer elements:
- opener: Contains dateline and/or block-level salute at the beginning of the letter
- closer: Contains signed and/or block-level salute and/or dateline at the end of the letter

## 4. Addresses
- Use an address tag for address sections. This can be a single line indicating the recipient or a postal address
- Use addrLine within address for single address information

**Exception from TEI valid encoding**: Contrary to the standard TEI content model, refrain from using an ab element - div elements may contain an address element without being nested in an ab element.

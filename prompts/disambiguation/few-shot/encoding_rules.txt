# General Guidelines

- Focus on accuracy over guessing
- Use the full letter text as primary evidence for disambiguation
- Consider biographical/geographical information
- If all candidates seem implausible, set "gnd" or "geonamesID" value to "unclear"
- Use the preferredName for the value of the writer key in the output JSON object; when gnd is "unclear", use the best inferable writer form from the input
- Provide a confidence score ranging from 1.0 (very certain) to 0.0 (not verifiable)

# Selection Rules

## GND (Persons)

**Name quality indicators:**
- Full names with particles are more reliable than abbreviated names
- Abbreviated names (e.g., "J.") may require more textual evidence

**Use letter text to identify:**
- Professional context (scholar, diplomat, artist, merchant)
- Topics discussed (orientalism, history, arts, trade)
- Locations and networks mentioned
- Relationships (colleague of X, student of Y)


## GeoNames (Places)

**Use letter text to identify:**
- Name of location in dateline or text
- Geographical context (other places mentioned)
- Political/cultural references (embassy, university)
- Travel routes or descriptions

**Prioritize:** Capitals (PPLC) and major cities over villages for diplomatic/scholarly correspondence


## Confidence Scores

**Persons:**
- 1.0: Full name + strong contextual evidence (profession, network, topics)
- 0.9: Full name + moderate contextual evidence
- 0.7-0.8: Name components (surname or forename) OR abbreviated name + strong evidence
- 0.5-0.6: Abbreviated name + moderate evidence
- <0.5: Weak evidence - flagged for human review (always use when GND "unclear")

**Places:**
- 1.0: Explicitly named in dateline + supported by geographical context
- 0.9: Name identified as writer's location in letter text + contextual support
- 0.7-0.8: Abbreviated place name + strong evidence
- 0.5-0.6: Abbreviated place name + moderate evidence
- <0.5: Weak evidence - flagged for human review (always use when geonamesID "unclear")


## Evidence levels:

Strong: Named explicitly in letter body, or externally verifiable
Moderate: Implied by context (address, signature style, known correspondents)

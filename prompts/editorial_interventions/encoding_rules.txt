# Encoding Rules for Editorial Interventions

## General Remarks:
- Maintain original historical spelling and orthography
- Do not use attributes in TEI tags
- For multiple intervention types in one sequence, separate with semicolon

### IMPORTANT:
Notation form is not prescriptive: Square brackets or [sic] markers indicate that an editorial intervention exists, but do not necessarily determine the TEI encoding — always derive the correct tag from the nature of the intervention, not its surface notation.


## 1. Abbreviation
- Use for intentional abbreviations by the original writer
- Examples: abbreviated words with periods (d. M. = dieses Monats), month names (Jany = January), titles/forms of address (Mr = Monsieur), acronyms (FO = Foreign Office), shortened words by dropping letters from the end (arab = arabisch) or from the middle (Jhdte = Jahrhunderte)
- Always use a choice tag with abbr tag for abbreviated form and expan tag for expanded form.

## 2. Correction
- Use for apparent errors by the original writer requiring correction
- Examples: wrong word choice, grammar or syntax errors
- Use sic tag only if correction is unclear, or use a choice tag with sic and corr tags if correction is clear. Always use complete words in both tags.

## 3. Supplement
- Use for missing content added by the editor for clarity/completeness
- Examples: missing punctuation marks, unintentionally omitted words, assumed name parts or units
- Use a supplied tag.

## 4. Omission
- Use for text passages omitted by the editor
- Examples: illegible/unreconstructable material
- Use a gap tag. The gap tag is always an empty element with no text content.

## 5. Uncertainty
- Use for text that has been reconstructed but remains uncertain.
- Example:  illegible/damaged text where a reading has been attempted but cannot be confirmed, often accompanied by question marks
- Use an unclear tag.

## 6. Redundant Text
- Use for text present in the source which seems superfluous or redundant
- Examples: unnecessary text repetitions
- Use a surplus tag.

# General Guidelines

- Focus on accuracy over guessing
- Provide a confidence score ranging from 1.0 (very certain) to 0.0 (very uncertain)
- Use the full letter text as primary evidence for disambiguation
- Consider all available biographical/geographical information
- If no clear match can be determined, choose the most likely candidate but assign a lower confidence score
- If all candidates seem implausible, set "gnd" or "geonamesID" value to "unk"

# Selection Rules

## GND (Persons)

**Name quality indicators:**
- Full names with particles are more reliable than abbreviated names
- Abbreviated names (e.g., "J.") may require more textual evidence

**Use letter text to identify:**
- Professional context (scholar, diplomat, artist, merchant)
- Topics discussed (orientalism, history, arts, trade)
- Locations and networks mentioned
- Relationships (colleague of X, student of Y)

**Time period:** Candidate must be alive during letter date (check birth/death years)


## GeoNames (Places)

**Use letter text to identify:**
- Geographical context (other places mentioned)
- Political/cultural references (embassy, university)
- Travel routes or descriptions

**Prioritize:** Capitals (PPLC) and major cities over villages for diplomatic/scholarly correspondence


## Confidence Scores

**Persons:**
- 1.0: Full name + strong textual evidence + date match
- 0.9: Full name + good textual evidence
- 0.7-0.8: Full name + some context OR abbreviated name + strong evidence
- 0.5-0.6: Abbreviated name + moderate evidence
- <0.5: Weak evidence or implausible match

**Places:**
- 1.0: Clear location evidence in text + feature type fits
- 0.9: Good contextual support + appropriate type
- 0.7-0.8: Some context + plausible location
- 0.5-0.6: Name match but limited context (favor larger cities)
- <0.5: Uncertain

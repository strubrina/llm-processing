# General Guidelines

- Focus on accuracy over guessing
- Provide a confidence score ranging from 1.0 (very certain) to 0.0 (very uncertain)
- Consider all available biographical information: birth/death years, professions, biographical notes
- If no clear match can be determined, choose the most likely candidate but assign a lower confidence score

# Selection Rules

## Time Period Matching:
- The collection spans 1794-1856
- Verify the candidate was alive during this period based on birth and death years
- Eliminate candidates who died before 1794 or were born after 1856

## Name Matching:
- Compare the writer's name with the candidate's preferredName
- Consider name abbreviations (e.g., "J." for Joseph or Johannes)
- Account for name particles (von, de, etc.)
- Consider gender implications of names where relevant

## Biographical Context:
- Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall was an Orientalist, diplomat, and historian
- Likely correspondents include scholars, diplomats, orientalists, historians, writers, nobility
- Consider professional and social circles of early 19th century Austrian-German intellectual life

## Confidence Scoring:
- 1.0: Perfect name match, time period fits, biographical context strongly supports
- 0.9-0.99: Strong name match, time period fits, biographical context supports
- 0.7-0.89: Good name match or time period fits with reasonable biographical context
- 0.5-0.69: Name match is ambiguous or biographical context is unclear but plausible
- Below 0.5: Uncertain match, use only if no better alternative exists

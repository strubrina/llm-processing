# Encoding Rules for Letter Structure

## General Remarks:
- Maintain original historical spelling and orthography, and preserve special characters and foreign words as they appear in the text
- Maintain original paragraph sectioning. Only mark new line beginnings in salutations
- Ensure consistency with TEI Guidelines (except for salutations and addresses - see rules below)
- Preserve the original structure, and order
- Do not abbreviate any text. Fully represent all letter content in the XML output
- Only return the XML code without additional explanations.

## Document sectioning
- Start with a body element as the root and use the following child elements for general structuring
- Use a div typed "letter" for the main letter including dateline, salutations, letter content, signature and postscript
- Use a div typed "address" for addresses

**Exception from TEI valid encoding**:

## 1. Contrary to the standard TEI content model, p elements may contain a salute element when the salutation is embedded within a paragraph and not visually set off as a separate block.

## 2. Contrary to the standard TEI content model, refrain from using an ab element - div elements may contain an address element without being nested in an ab element.

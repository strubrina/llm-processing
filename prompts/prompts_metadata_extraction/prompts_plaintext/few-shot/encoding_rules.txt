# General Guidelines

- Focus on accuracy over completeness
- Provide a confidence score, ranging from 1.0 (very sure) to 0.0 (extremely unsure)

# Normalization Rules

## Date Normalization:
- Convert dates to W3C format (YYYY-MM-DD) where possible
- If no date available, write: unk

## Place Normalization:
- Normalize common variations to contemporary German standard spelling (e.g., "Wien" for Vienna, "Konstantinopel" for Constantinople)
- If no clear place is mentioned, write: unk

## Name Normalization:
- Extract the writer's full name, if known
- Normalize to: Surname, Forename Particle, Role|Rank|Title
- Resolve abbreviations only, if very certain of the person's name
- For multi-part names separated by "von", "de", or similar particles, use them after
- Include titles, ranks, or honorifics if available

## Language Normalization:
- Identify the main language of the letter
